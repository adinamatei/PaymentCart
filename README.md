# Payment Cart Layout

The CSS Grid Layout is a system that offers a new way to design grid-based user interfaces. Even if is't not widly suported yet by browsers, I decided to give it a try and see how `display: grid` works.


The best way to experiment with Grid, is to use the browser with special flags enabled:

* Chrome: navigate to `chrome://flags` and enable "experimental web platform features"
* Firefox: enable the layout.css.grid.enabled flag
* Opera: navigate to `opera://flags` and enable "experimental web platform features"
* to check for other browsers support and more details visit [caniuse](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid)
