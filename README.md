# Payment Cart Layout

The CSS Grid Layout is a system that offer a new way to design grid-based user interfaces. Even if is't not widly suported yet by browsers, I decided to give it a try and see how { display: grid } works.


The best bet to experiment with Grid, is to use the browser with special flags enabled:

* for Chrome [chrome://flags](chrome://flags/) and enable "experimental web platform features"
* for Firefox enable the layout.css.grid.enabled flag
* for Opera [opera://flags](opera://flags/) and enable "experimental web platform features"
* to check for other browsers support and more details visit [Caniuse](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid)

And also, I've added some JavaScript.
